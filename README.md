# 📂 File Organizer CLI Tool

This is a simple Python command-line tool that organizes files in a folder into subfolders based on file type (like PDFs, images, or code files).

## 💡 Why I Built It
I made this to practice Python scripting and solve a small real-life problem — keeping my folders clean and sorted automatically.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Open terminal, go to the folder, and run:
```bash
python organizer.py
